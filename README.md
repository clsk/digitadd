There are two ways to approach this.
```        Sum by column Only      Sum by row, then column
 1345       1|3|4|5|                  1|3|4|5|
  832         8|3|2|           OR   +   8|3|2| 
  437         4|3|7|                  --------
-----       --------              R|E|S|U|L|T|
                                    +  |4|3|7|
                                      --------

Approaching the problem using the sum by row, then column appears easier from an algorithmic perspective.
So, going to approach it that way to begin with.
